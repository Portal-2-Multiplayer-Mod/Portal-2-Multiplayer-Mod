# Data System Terminology:
# Enabled: The data system has started successfully on the python scripts end
# Disabled: The data system didn't start successfully on the python scripts end
# Running: By default the data system is set to run with every play session, there is a option in the hidden menu that devs can use to disable it for testing purposes
# Not Running: The user has defined in the hidden menu setting they do not want the data system to run next play session or the system is disabled by a error which occured

# Verification Statuses:
# The point of these statuses is to tell users in the Datas menu the kind of compatibility it is with the p2mm mod
# Offical: This is an official map by Valve or by a p2mm dev member, it has been made or designed to work with p2mm and has been approved by someone on the p2mm dev team. No one outside the p2mm dev team should have status with a map they created.
# Verified: The map has been tested and verified by a p2mm dev to work with the p2mm mod.
# Playable: The map can be run with multiple players, but the map still has issues in certain parts or functionalities. Players should be able to complete the map from start to finish. Mainly minor bugs or glitches put it into this state until they have been resolved.
# Unplayable: A map can be marked with this if the p2mm breaks the map entirely, making it unplayable with the mod, or the map itself can not function as intended with more than the initial amount of players used to test the map.
# Not Tested: The map has yet to be tested by a p2mm dev. We can not guarantee this means the map will work.
