# 1.5 VS 2.0
**You may have noticed that there hasn't been a new release for the better half of a year** ***(241 days at the time of writing)*****.
In this time we have made ALOT of progress** ***(972 commits as of this moment),*** **however due to the method that we have handled the previous version of the mod,
updating isn't going to be an option until the launcher has been fully finished.
Because of this, there is many stability fixes and features (nametags, singleplayer support, linux support, etc) in the new version of the mod. 
In its current stage, 1.5 is severely outdated, however 2.0 also has its issues mainly that its more difficult to install, aswell as stablity between updates.
The current plan is to make a usable beta for 2.0, but for now you have to choose between 1.5 or 2.0. A pros and cons list will be provided to help you decide.**

***1.5***
```
+ stable and easy to install
+ updating will be VERY easy once 2.0 comes out
- lacks many features
- very broken
- coded badly
- doesnt work well with the new portal 2 update
- windows only
```

***2.0***
```
+ has many new features (nametags, singleplayer support, chat commands, stability, prop creation, improved spawn detection, spawn in any map, gelocity support, launcher patching)
+ linux support
+ rewitten code (much cleaner and runs way faster)
+ more likely to work with every portal 2 update
+ stable launcher
+ better file-structure
- will take longer to install (requires python)
- can break any time you download a commit
- isn't easy to update
```
